1. linear reg. 


linear between inpendent & dependent vars

residuals are independent

residuals follow normal(0, sigma^2)

2.logsitc reg

loss = sum_i / n * ( -

 log(p) - (1 - y) log(1 - p) ) where p is the model predicted

p =  1 / (1 + exp^(a*x + b))

data: 0 ~ 1
    
y: binary {0,1}

4. imbalanced data

Recall = TP / (TP + FN)
Precision = TP / (TP + FP)
